## Short descritption of the project

Creation of a pseudo-site (language school) with 3 pages: course description, course registration, registration confirmation. The site includes a form and a validation process of the submitted data.

It is about a small project that is realized alone.

## Course description page

Inclusion of a link to the course registration page (button).

## Course registration page

Insertion of a form with different fields.

## Registration confirmation page

Display of the submitted data after a validation process.

## Validation process/JavaScript

JavaScript is used as an external file for the validation process. The validation is done as far as possible via functions.

## Continue

The unresolved parts remain in the code as comments. The project will be developed further after delivery.
